## UML
  The `UML.pdf` is the combined document that depicts the *Use-Case diagrams, Class diagrams, State-Chart diagrams and the Sequence
  diagrams* of the software
  
## Coding
  The software's source codes i.e .java files are present in the `wms/src` directory. 
  The associated class files for the java files are present in the `wms/build/classes` directory. The `dist` folder contains
  the *jar* files and associated library files for the software after building. 
    
  **Note:** The software is made using *Netbeans 8.1* IDE and associated Swing and Database libraries of the IDE.
